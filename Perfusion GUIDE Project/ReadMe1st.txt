To use the DCE-MRI Perfusion GUI:

1. Browse to pft_DceMriPerfusionGui\for_redistribution_files_only.

2. Edit Source-Folder.txt and Target-Folder.txt (you can do this by running the script pft_InitialiseFolders).

3. Try to run pft_DceMriPerfusionGui.exe.

4. If that fails, either install MATLAB 2015aSP1, or the appropriate MATLAB Compiler Runtime (probably W10 64-bit, 2015aSP1).
   Your first port of call should probably be LMS IT support, but you can also DL the MCR from the Internet. 
   Or, you can visit:

   https://uk.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html

   Look for MATLAB 2015aSP1 (8.5.1), either 32-bit or 64-bit, depending on your OS.

5. Once you have the program working, just create a shortcut to and it and move it to your Desktop.
